### What I learned

This project was just used to study both html5 and css3, remember tags and how to use classes and identifiers.
as in the example below:

<div class="receita" id="receita">  
   <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
     <li> <b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
      You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
      
      <li> <b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
      
      <li> <b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
      the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
      
      <li> <b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
      middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
      
      <li> <b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
      fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
      
      <li> <b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
